TODO

All

Comment everything
Fix all of the if spec[key] shit
  - Add addInteraction functionality to main.ts

**** (Luxury)
Refactor out all of the rendering junk
Maybe make a function that tests the spec for completeness

Context

// Does context need to be a backbone model?
// How to have only one var for classname that is used in parsing, and in the Context?
// How does all of this overloading stuff work in TypeScript?

****
Make so things can be added incrementally

Node

Split ContextNode/ContextView/ContextModel?
Checkargument in context and ispropertyreference in node overlap a little, refactor to one method in context
Add some more features to contextview, comment it
Figure out how to simplify the parsing decision tree (extend plugins)
// Also make explicit what elements are which
// Get rid of refresh :[
// do something about view classnames
// Fix the event shit in the constructor of ContextNode
// Fix the event shit in the parseProperties of ContextNode where it listens to objects

****
None :(

DataSet

// Make it somehow know which properties an item should have
// Make transforms make sense
How would data series be represented?

Area

// Somehow delegate layout to this shit?
// Figure out how to lay out axes and do padding in a nice way
// AreaView needs to be refactored it seems, a lot of the view code in general is pretty ghetto

Scale

// Remove recalculate and move that stuff to the getter
// Create a date scale to test if it makes sense
// Should zoom and pan and stuff like that be part of the class? (yes it should)

Axis

// Axis rendering is totally jacked up
Styling options?
Events and stuff are janky

Mark

Fix mark parsing
Fix mark events, this is the main issue right now
Create mark API, look at jchart or something
Consistent styling?
Maybe specifying scales and stuff should use the same syntax as everywhere else

Interaction

Add some features of contextNode like auto-parsing of object references, not sure how to handle view and model stuff
Make the unique ID for interactions better, or improve the de-conflicting of events

TODO

All

Styling options?
  - Outside of Lyra, simple CSS
Fix all of the if spec[key] shit
  - Add addInteraction functionality to main.ts

**** (Luxury)
Add Tests
Comment everything
Refactor out all of the rendering junk
Maybe make a function that tests the spec for completeness

Context

// Does context need to be a backbone model?
// How to have only one var for classname that is used in parsing, and in the Context?
// How does all of this overloading stuff work in TypeScript?

****
Make so things can be added incrementally

Node

Split ContextNode/ContextView/ContextModel?
Checkargument in context and ispropertyreference in node overlap a little, refactor to one method in context
Add some more features to contextview, comment it
Figure out how to simplify the parsing decision tree (extend plugins)
// Also make explicit what elements are which
// Get rid of refresh :[
// do something about view classnames
// Fix the event shit in the constructor of ContextNode
// Fix the event shit in the parseProperties of ContextNode where it listens to objects

****
None :(

DataSet

// Make it somehow know which properties an item should have
// Make transforms make sense
How would data series be represented?

Area

// Somehow delegate layout to this shit?
// Figure out how to lay out axes and do padding in a nice way
// AreaView needs to be refactored it seems, a lot of the view code in general is pretty ghetto

Scale

// Remove recalculate and move that stuff to the getter
// Create a date scale to test if it makes sense
// Should zoom and pan and stuff like that be part of the class? (yes it should)

Axis

// Axis rendering is totally jacked up
// Events and stuff are janky

Mark

Create mark API, look at jchart or something
Consistent styling?
Maybe specifying scales and stuff should use the same syntax as everywhere else
****
Fix mark parsing
Fix mark events, this is the main issue right now # Determine which marks are clicked or dragged on

Interaction

Add some features of contextNode like auto-parsing of object references, not sure how to handle view and model stuff
Make the unique ID for interactions better, or improve the de-conflicting of events
